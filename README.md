# SNP Filter

SNP filter reads the social media posts and filters the results based on three specifications to detect the posts containing terrorist propaganda:
  * Terrorism Tags
  * Motivation Tags
  * Out-of-context (OOC) Tags
  
Sample content of each Tag set is given in the table below:

Tag Set  | Content
------------- | -------------
Terrorist Tags (S1)  | {Terrorist, Terrorism, etc.}
Motivation Tags (S2)  | {Encourage, Inspire, etc.}
OOC Tags (S3)  | {"Name of People from Unrelated Context", etc.}
